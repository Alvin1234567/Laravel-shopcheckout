# UI/UX

Better user interface with navigation bar
function follow and interactions need to be review.
Should be in one age load, instead of redirect
Responsive

# CD/CI

Auto deploy is a must (missing composer install/update, creating testing data) - limited by the developer's experience
Need the following phpunit testing:
    check out amount
    webpage check
QA process need to be implemented through git.


# Design and future enhancment

Controllers need to be RESTful driven
Error handling, access loging, function performance logging need to be developed
Introduc user interface testing
Google analystic tracking
Checkout reconsilation system for finance
Websocket can be introduced for real time transaction
Better to seperate database and application for performance tunning and scollbility (adapt a full laravel deployment solution with web, app, db, cache)
State manager (session controller) can be introdced if site is busy.
Running in to a dependency issue, need to resolve it from docker
